### Development Environment

#### Prerequisites

-   Node.js v21.6.1
-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Mu2Mi is built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, Minio, and Redis. The development environment is orchestrated with Docker Compose. To set up your development environment:

1. Have the required dependencies installed on your machine and the repository cloned.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Use the `.env.example` file as a template and fill out the values required. The `.env.example` file has some default values that you can use. Rate limiting, captcha, email, and analytics are disabled by default in development. You can view the [environment variable schema](src/config/env.ts) to see which are required for booting up the Next.js server.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run `make up` to start the development environment. _Quick tip: The `Makefile` and `compose.yaml` files are used to manage the development environment and contain other useful commands_.
4. Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.
7. Run `make down` to stop the development environment.
8. (Optional) Run `make clean` to remove all persistent Docker volumes and images.

#### Testing Track Processing Functionality

To test out track processing functionality that uses Replicate service, you will need to have Replicate API token and webhook secret, which can be generated in your Replicate account settings, configured as environment variables in your `.env` file. And you will also need to set up tunnels using either [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/). The two tunnels needed should be set up for the following ports:

-   3000 (Next.js)
-   9000 (Minio)

Once the tunnels are set up, update these variables in your `.env`:

-   `PROTOCOL` to `https`
-   `HOST` to the Next.js tunnel URL
-   `APP_PORT` to `443` for `https` connection
-   `S3_ENDPOINT` to the Minio tunnel URL
-   `S3_PORT` to `443` for `https` connection
-   `S3_USE_SSL` to `true` for `https` connection

You may also need to restart the Next.js server to apply the changes.

### Codebase Overview

#### Data Access Layer

Exported functions in the `src/models` directory are ready to be consumed in Route Handlers, Server Actions, and Server Components. They act as a data access layer and interact with the database.

#### Data Fetching and Mutation

Server Components get their data from queries in `queries.ts` files, re-export queries from `actions.ts` to get them inside the `'use server'` boundary, which enables the use of `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks in Client Components. Route Handlers should be wrapped with `withErrorHandling` in [the error module](src/lib/error.ts) to handle errors.

Server Actions in `actions.ts` files. Server Actions should be wrapped with either `action` or `authAction` in [the safe-action module](src/lib/safe-action.ts) to handle errors and add the current user and session to the context.
