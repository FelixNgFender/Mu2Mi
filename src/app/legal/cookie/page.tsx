                your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes

                need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can
                prevent these cookies from being stored however this may

                We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
                Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard
                options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
                functionality and features they add to this site. It is
                recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
                service that you use.

                You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings
                on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be
                aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of
                this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies
                will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
                features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you
                do not disable cookies.
